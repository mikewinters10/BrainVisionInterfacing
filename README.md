# BrainVisionInterfacing

This repository is for extracting a live data stream from the BrainVision EEG equipment and storing/processing it in other programs, such as matlab.

##MATALB Folder Contents:

###block info.txt

Contains informaiton about the data formatting of the OSC messages generated by python driver (pycorder)

###unpackBlock.m

Matlab function which translates OSC messages recieved from the UDP buffer into a matlab structure

###BVinterface.m

Matlab GUI for real-time data streaming, processing, and visualization.
- Receives EEG data from the python driver via UDP connection and translates it into a matlab array
- Stores this data in a useful format for matlab
- Can do real-time data processing/visualization (the code is structured for speed)
- Has the infrastructure for doing experiments for synchronizing data with stimuli (ex. midi sequences)

###BVinterface.fig

Figure binary file associated with BVinterface GUI, containing information about the positions/properties of the various elements in the GUI

###data\

Folder storing data files saved by the GUI. Files are named by the date/time when they are created.
