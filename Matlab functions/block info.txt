--OSC MESSAGE INFO--
Bytes per OSC message: 3,908   (based on 25 time samples per block)

OSC message layout:
- Address String (ex. '/startup')
- List of contents (ex. ',sfffff....fff' where 's' is string, 'f' is float, etc. - not sure what ',' is)
- Contents
* Information sections are separated by 4 "space" bytes (value of 0)

Notes:
- There is a single zero-byte at the end of a string (e.g. after the timestamp and before the first float for these messages)
- The number of floats contained, divided by the number of channels (31), is the number of values recorded per channel per block (at the current sampling rate this is 25)
- The floats are Big-endian (the bytes are ordered from most significant to least significant)
- Each float is 4 bytes long (single-precision)
- There is no ending information - the last bytes are the last item in the contents list
- Sometimes the message might be cut short, i.e. the contents list is bigger than the actual contents. In this case, the informaiton is lost :(
