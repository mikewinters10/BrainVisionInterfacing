--OSC MESSAGE INFO--
Bytes per OSC message: 3,908
Information sections are separated by 4 "space" bytes (value of 0)
OSC message layout:
- address (ex. '/startup')
- list of contents (ex. ',sfffff....fff' where 's' is string, 'f' is float, etc. - not sure what ',' is)
- contents

Notes:
- there is a single zero after the timestamp and before the first float
- the number of floats contained, divided by 31, is the number of values recorded per channel per block (at the sampling rate this is 25)
- the floats are Big-endian, e.g. they are ordered from most significant (large value changes) to least significant (small value changes)
- each float is 4 bytes long
- there is no ending information - the last byte is the last value for the last float
